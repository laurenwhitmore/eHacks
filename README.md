# eHacks

#Introduction

This project was made for the eHacks hackathon. The goal of this project was to create a google chrome page that you can add to the home page of your chrome to aid in organizing your life and learning to become more financially literate. Through research, we found that the most financially illiterate groups in Canada were younger, university aged people. This group of people spends so much time online in their day to day life that we decided that if they are able to be exposed to more information regarding finances that they will learn and become more responsible with money.

# Requirements
